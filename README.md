# TokenMint Smart Contract

The TokenMint smart contract is a basic implementation for creating and managing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows token minting, burning, and transfer functionalities.

## Features

- **Token Minting**: The contract owner can mint new tokens and increase the total token supply.
- **Token Burning**: Token holders can burn their tokens, reducing the total token supply.
- **Token Transfer**: Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses.

## Contract Details

- **Token Name**: "token"
- **Token Symbol**: "TKN"
- **Total Supply**: 10,000 tokens (initial)

## Usage

1. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the `TokenMint` smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Mint Tokens**: As the contract owner, use the `mint` function to mint new tokens and distribute them to specific addresses.
3. **Burn Tokens**: Token holders can burn their tokens using the `burn` function.
4. **Transfer Tokens**: Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses using the `transfer` function.

## Functions

- **mint(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)**: Mint `_amount` tokens and send them to `_recipient`. Only the contract owner can perform this action.

- **burn(uint256 _amount)**: Burn `_amount` tokens from the sender's balance.

- **transfer(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)**: Transfer `_amount` tokens to `_recipient` from the sender's balance.

## Modifiers

- **onlyOwner**: Restricts access to functions only to the contract owner.

## Example Usage

```
// Deploy the contract
TokenMint token = new TokenMint();

// Mint tokens (as the contract owner)
token.mint(address recipient, uint256 amount);

// Burn tokens
token.burn(uint256 amount);

// Transfer tokens
token.transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount);
```

## Note

- Make sure to set proper access controls and handle permissions carefully, especially for minting new tokens.
- Review and understand the implications of token burning and its impact on the token economy.
